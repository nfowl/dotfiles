## Why Home Manager/nix 🤔?

Managing all the various tools and repos that were needed to go from a new install to a fully operational battlestation was quite time consuming and painful to document. especially adding in some of the plugin managers that required either a git clone or a random file downloaded and installed in a spot.

Home Manager has support for adding multiple machines and has a nice interface for setting up/installing nvim and tmux (with some downsides 🙁)
